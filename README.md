# NUI

The "No JavaScript" User Interface (NUI) project is an **experimental** web UI library with the goal of allowing developers to create rich, interactive web pages without writing a single line of JavaScript. 

## EXPERIMENT!!

NUI is an **experiment** and therefore:

* Should **not** be used until otherwise specified
* Is not ready to accept pull requests
* Does not have documentation
* May be discontinued at any point in time without warning

## Goals

* Figure out just how much JavaScript is necessary for common patterns
* Determine if it's feasible to not write a single line of JavaScript to initialize components
